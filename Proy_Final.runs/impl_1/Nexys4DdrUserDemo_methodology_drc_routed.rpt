2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock inst_servo/clock_instance/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_100_clk_wiz_100_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100_clk_wiz_100_1 and clk_50_clk_wiz_50_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100_clk_wiz_100_1] -to [get_clocks clk_50_clk_wiz_50_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_100_clk_wiz_100_1 and clk_50_clk_wiz_50_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_100_clk_wiz_100_1] -to [get_clocks clk_50_clk_wiz_50_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock inst_servo/clock_instance/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin inst_servo/clock_instance/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
